# infographyl

infographyl is a super light weight java web application built on the spring-mvc framework, utilizing Hiberbate/JPA integrated with MySQL for the Persistence layer, jTable and RESTful service implementations for simple CRUD capabilities to the data stored in the database, and Twitter Bootstrap for the front end implmentation. 

infographyl (in its first iteration)* is a simple infographic viewer where users can randomly view interesting/funny/cool infographics, all you need to do is refresh and you'll see a new infographic.
